          "description": "Colombia Buenaventura LNG Import Study PIO is developing the Regasificadora del Pacifico (RDP) – an LNG import terminal in Buenaventura, Colombia. The terminal includes a Floating Storage Unit (FSU) moored 6 kilometers offshore Buenaventura; a barge or Offshore Service Vessel (OSV) that transfers ISO containers filled at the FSU to shore; and cranes that transfer the ISO containers from the barge or OSV to trucks that will transport the ISO containers to a regasification facility in Buga where gas will be injected onto the TGI pipeline. The Client retained Astris Finance as its financial advisor to assist in raising the capital to finance the Project. The assignment's main objective is to analyze the LNG supply chain segment from loading LNG onto ISO containers aboard a barge or OSV to its delivery at the inlet of the regasification facility in Buga. K&M was retained to estimate the following the optimal number of ISO containers, trucks, chassis trailers, stackers, and mobile cranes; the optimal size of the barge; and the operating cost (fuel, lube oil, tires, personnel, etc.) of the ISO logistics supply chain. Specifically, K&M will utilize its existing logistics model for onshore LNG transport and include modifications related to the barge transport from the FSU to the port. K&M will include a sensitivity analysis on variables such as diesel prices, useful life of the ISO containers, etc. A report with the results of the analysis and the Excel logistics model will be provided to the Client upon completion of the assignment."

The model should forecast electricity generation based on forecasts for key independent variables such as temperature, tourism arrivals, distributed generation, EV usage, and others agreed with WEB. Under this assignment, K&M was responsible for collecting and validating historical data for Aruba, including hourly temperature, humidity, tourism arrivals, distributed solar PV additions, and others. K&M processed the data by cleaning missing values, aligning different time resolutions, and applying smoothing techniques. Using historical data, K&M analyzed the correlation between the dependent variable, Peak Load (MW), and each of the independent variables to determine which variables to include in the polynomial regression analysis. Based on the regression analysis, K&M developed the forecasting model, which can predict WEB’s peak load based on forecasted data for the period 2025 – 2029. K&M will provide this model as a workbook to WEB, which includes a user-friendly dashboard for data visualization and scenario analysis, as well as a user manual."

Under this assignment, K&M reviewed the proposals submitted by MAN and BWSC for the dual-fuel conversion of Engine Room 5 and developed a final project scope and price (if applicable) to enable CUC to solicit bids. K&M began by reviewing MAN's proposal and their scope of services matrix, followed by an evaluation of the scope described in the BWSC proposal. K&M then developed a comprehensive list of systems and BOP (Balance of Plant) equipment items required for the conversion to gas. Next, K&M compared the BWSC proposed scope to MAN's scope matrix and the internally developed list to identify any gaps or additional work that might have been necessary. The team also reviewed the mechanical and technical specifications, provided detailed comments, and prepared a list of clarification questions for BWSC, MAN, and CUC as needed. Following this, K&M evaluated the responses to these clarifications and incorporated the findings into the scope matrix and, if required, into the total price proposed by BWSC. Finally, K&M prepared a detailed report summarizing the activities performed, presenting the final project scope and price (if applicable).

Given Kenya's increased reliance on renewable energy sources—particularly geothermal, wind, and solar—the integration of utility-scale, grid-connected BESS is essential for addressing grid stability, managing excess energy during low demand, and enhancing the share of renewable power. As intermittent renewable energy capacity grows, it has introduced new challenges, such as the need for load balancing and ancillary services to ensure grid stability. The objectives of this study are to establish a policy, legal, and regulatory framework to attract private investment in BESS, while also examining best practices from other countries. The study will identify gaps in the existing framework, explore financing and ownership models, and evaluate the risks and mitigation strategies relevant to private sector involvement in BESS. Additionally, it will provide capacity building to strengthen government and stakeholder knowledge on managing and implementing these frameworks effectively. Through these efforts, the assignment aims to position BESS as a critical component of Kenya’s grid infrastructure, contributing to a more reliable, sustainable, and flexible power system in alignment with national green energy goals. K&M’s scope of work includes the following",

In this assignment, K&M was responsible for researching offshore wind design considerations, identifying offshore wind siting and configurations viable for Aruba, and calculating the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of various offshore wind scenarios. The offshore wind design research covered topics such as siting considerations (including water depths, distance to shore, wind speeds, spacing, and shipping routes), substructure types, wind turbine sizing and transmission options, and estimated CAPEX and OPEX for key offshore wind components. Based on these factors, K&M performed a high-level siting analysis for Aruba and developed cost estimates for wind farms of three sizes. The analysis included a discussion of the indicative Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) capacity that should be added to WEB’s grid to provide sufficient operating reserves for each scenario. Based on these results, K&M estimated the LCOE generated by each offshore wind/BESS scenario. K&M delivered its findings in a PowerPoint presentation to WEB staff."

          "name": "Financial, Market, and Climate Analysis Regarding a Transition from Coal in Mauritius Biomass power generation was considered an attractive option for the Mauritian island grid because it offered dispatchable generation, utilized agricultural waste as fuel, and had lower emissions than fossil fuel technologies. The climate rationale to transition the Omnicane Independent Power Producer (IPP) to 100% biomass was even stronger, as it would displace CO₂-intensive coal generation with local or imported biomass generation. Despite its benefits, biomass power generation projects were risky and potentially unpopular. One of the main risks was feedstock supply. Biomass supply could present significant seasonal variations, which, combined with storage limitations, could lead to supply-demand imbalances. Additionally, biomass supply experienced year-to-year variability due to fluctuations in crop yields or reductions in cultivated land. Biomass projects also had the potential to be controversial and attract local criticism. IFC was aware of these risks and concerns surrounding biomass and the Omnicane project and therefore commissioned this high-level study to analyze the financial, economic, and climate implications of transitioning the Omnicane IPP to 100% biomass. The goal of the study was to use data and objective analysis to determine whether the transition represented a better economic and climate choice compared to continuing the current biomass-coal operation or investing in another dispatchable, low-emissions technology. To support this work, K&M developed an LCOE model to estimate the cost and CO₂ emissions of the following generation scenarios",

Based on the role WEB Aruba expected an SMR to have in Aruba’s generation portfolio, K&M recommended one or more SMR configurations that could meet WEB Aruba’s needs. Performed high-level regulatory, permitting, and fuel analysis. This included understanding any applicable international agreements or conventions that could apply to the project and assessing whether any legal or regulatory barriers posed fatal risks. Reviewed at a high level the environmental, health, and safety impacts of an SMR project in Aruba to understand potential effects and assess for fatal flaws. Examined options for sourcing enriched uranium and evaluated whether any fatal risks existed for Aruba to use these sources. K&M also developed an Excel-based model to analyze the financial viability of an SMR reactor in the Aruba system. The model calculated the total kWh produced annually by the SMR, resource requirements (e.g., uranium, water), and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) generated by the SMR. K&M ran the model, analyzed the results, and determined whether or not SMRs were worth pursuing further. If SMR technology was deemed to be worth pursuing, K&M developed a roadmap outlining all the activities and phases required to continue the development of an SMR plant."

As a result, SEPCO has reviewed potential solutions for its Samra Power Plant to increase power plant generation during these peak periods. SEPCO intent is to modify all seven gas turbines installed at the Samra Power Plant by installing a fogging system in the gas turbine inlet. This modification aims to increase plant power generation to help the power grid cover the peak loads during high-temperature periods. To evaluate the technical and commercial viability of the fogging system installation, SEPCO engaged K&M Advisors to review the design of generating units’ and auxiliary equipment and systems to evaluate their ability to support the increased power output during fogging system operation. The purpose of this study is to",

Fogging System RFP Development Once the technical viability of implementing the fogging system has been confirmed, SEPCO will need to develop an RFP for suppliers to submit their proposal for design that meets the requirements of applicable standards and good engineering practice. K&M will develop the RFP documentation for suppliers to ensure that the design of the system is adequate and technically sound. Fogging System Analysis K&M developed GateCycle models of combined cycle plants to calculate heat and material balances for different ambient temperatures without and with the fogging system. For each combination of the ambient temperature and fogging system status, K&M developed a spreadsheet summarizing the system power output and power output increase, heat rate and heat rate change, fogging system evaporation rate/demineralized water requirements, and other steam and water impacting operation of HRSG, steam turbine, ACC, and other auxiliary equipment that could be impacted by the fogging system. To analyze the demineralized system requirements, K&M calculated the fogging system demineralized water requirements and the total daily demineralized water demand and compared it with the demineralized water system capacity. We evaluated whether there is a deficit of demineralized water with fogging system operation and suggested the required additional demineralized water system capacity. Fogging System RFP Development K&M will assist SEPCO in developing the fogging system RFP. The RFP document prepared by K&M will include instructions to bidders, functional technical specification including the scope of supply and services and general technical requirements, and forms to be submitted by bidders. It is expected that the draft supply contract will be prepared to be included in the RFP will be based on the standard SEPCO’s supply contract, so no draft contract preparation is included in K&M’s scope. SEPCO will provide K&M with any available technical and commercial information received to date from the prospective fogging system suppliers."

(Vivo) has recently signed a partnership agreement with Chariot Oil & Gas Holdings (Morocco) Limited (Chariot), jointly together referred to as the Partners. The intention of the Partnership is to develop a gas-to-industry solution in Morocco to monetize a portion of the resources from the Anchois field (the “Project”). The Project will utilize processed gas at the fence of the upstream Central Processing Facility (CPF), liquefy or compress it, and then deliver the liquified or compressed gas to various industrial users (mainly, but not limited to, ceramists and aluminum products factories located in Tangiers, Casablanca, Berrechid, and Kenitra) using a virtual pipeline to locations no more than 400 km from the CPF and volumes of up to 20MMScfd. K&M will develop an indicative estimate of the gas volume that needs to be compressed or liquified at the CPF and determine the indicative capacity and configuration of the gas compressing or liquefaction and filling stations. Based on the gas volume estimate and configuration of the CPF, K&M will then estimate the costs for transporting LNG/CNG from the CPF and storing and decompressing or regasifying at the end-user sites. K&M will then assess at what price LNG/CNG will be cost-competitive with the fuel currently used by the end user and if LNG or CNG will deliver the highest potential margins to the partners. Once a storage method (LNG or CNG) has been determined to deliver the most returns, K&M will develop two or three business model options for the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that the Partners would create for the gas-to-industry business. The Partners will select one of the business model options and K&M will develop a Project financial model based on the business model selected. K&M will then develop an indicative term sheet for the CNG, LNG, or Gas Supply Agreement between the SPV and end users."

Vivo Energy hired K&M to conduct a technical and price assessment for the supply of energy (in the form of gas and power) to the proposed alumina refinery. K&M estimated GAC’s levelized cost of energy for electricity, steam, and calcination at the refinery. Two different demand scenarios were analyzed. K&M identified the lowest-cost supply solutions to provide this energy with LNG. To achieve this, K&M adopted a proprietary LNG costing model used in previous analyses to include the two demand scenarios and multiple energy supply options. K&M performed conceptual design and layout work, developed cost estimates, and conducted a business case analysis for each energy supply option and demand scenario."

To this end, the background check included a review of each tenderer’s legal, reputational, and financial background. The background check was performed using publicly available information. K&M calculated the financial ratios that indicate the tenderers’ financial strength relative to the SRWO turnkey contract size and performance guarantee. K&M obtained the information to calculate these ratios from the financial statements included in the tenderers’ latest annual reports and/or the financial information submitted by the tenderers in the expression of interest."

Renewable energy’s intermittency and other limitations pose a challenge to grid operators and intermediaries like GreenCo. Utility-scale energy storage is key to facing these challenges. Therefore, to complement its growing solar PV portfolio, GreenCo plans to develop a portfolio of BESS projects to help balance the intermittency of RE and shifting / flattening supply curves. The first of such BESS projects is expected to be co-located with GreenCo’s PV Pilot Project. The feasibility study will assess the technical, economic, and financial viability of developing and implementing the BESS Pilot in Sesheke District, Zambia and provide recommendations for the expanded 400 MWh BESS Portfolio.

          "description": "Trinidad and Tobago GH2 Project Implementation The IADB hired the KBR team to assist the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in developing and implementing green hydrogen demonstration projects. K&M was responsible for conducting financial and economic analyses of these projects, aiming to assess production costs, analyze economic benefits, and propose suitable business models for implementation. Under this project, K&M created a financial and economic model of the demonstration projects with an estimated aggregate size of USD 120 million in investment. This analysis forecasted cash flow and financial results for each project and consolidated the projections to show overall program results. The financial model for each project considered factors such as size, initial and operational expenses, investment timing, renewable energy costs, green hydrogen production costs (including electrolyzer expenses, water costs, operational and maintenance expenses, and storage costs), and costs associated with downstream products like green ammonia, green methanol, or green cement production. The model also projected the quantity of electricity, green hydrogen, and other products generated by each project and estimated the required investments through cash flow projections based on the initial expenses. It further calculated the levelized costs of electricity, hydrogen, and other products, considering factors like production, conditioning, storage, and relevant expenses. By disaggregating the costs of green hydrogen and ammonia, the model identified the main cost drivers, including electricity, storage, electrolyzer CAPEX, and operational expenses. Additionally, the model assessed the economic and financial viability of each project and the overall program, establishing key performance indicators (KPIs). It also allowed for sensitivity analysis of critical variables and remained flexible enough to incorporate new projects. K&M also led the design of the business model and financial structure for the projects. K&M proposed three different business models, assigning activities to both private and public partners, and worked with the government to determine the most suitable model. The analysis evaluated the role of the public sector in facilitating the business model and included a comprehensive risk assessment, covering commercial, technical, financial, and socio-environmental risks. K&M allocated risks among operators, investors, government, and financiers, and proposed strategies for risk mitigation. Furthermore, K&M analyzed the financial viability and structure of the business model, considering the financial revenue and returns for each project and all involved parties. K&M provided additional support to KBR in various activities. Firstly, it examined the challenges and opportunities related to renewable energy and green hydrogen production, considering the entire value chain. Based on this perspective, K&M developed recommendations for the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and public institutions to facilitate and promote future investments in these projects, ensuring maximum benefits were realized. Secondly, K&M prepared the necessary documentation to initiate the procurement process for each demonstration project. This documentation included technical specifications, drawings, budgets, procurement types, and strategies for the expression of interest (EOI) and request for proposal (RFP) processes, adhering to industry best practices and IDB procurement policies. K&M also created a procurement plan listing all the necessary procurements required for project implementation, aligned with the business model and the responsible parties. Budgets, procurement types, and strategies for the EOI and RFP processes were outlined for each procurement, following the best industry practices and IDB procurement policies. Lastly, K&M assisted the IDB and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in preparing the required material to secure international funds. This involved preparing the necessary documentation for the demonstration projects to access funds, with K&M leading the financial and economic aspects while KBR contributed to the technical aspects. The documentation was tailored for up to three funds, including the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the European Union (EU) Latin America and Caribbean Investment Facility (LACIF), and any other international donors or agencies agreed upon by the Government and the IDB."

K&M Advisors was retained to assist NEPCO with expert evidence and advisory support to resolve disputes with the project counterparty, Mahatat Al Zarqa Le Taweeed Al Takah Al Kahrabaieh (APZ). The focus of K&M’s engagement was on leveraging its extensive expertise in Independent Power Producer (IPP) projects and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to strengthen NEPCO’s position in the arbitration. The project required K&M to act as a trusted advisor and witness in the proceedings, providing technical, financial, and commercial insights related to IPP agreements, project development, and implementation processes. K&M’s team, led by Ralph Fairbanks and supported by Lenny Golbin, was instrumental in providing expert evidence and advisory support for NEPCO’s arbitration process. Specifically, Mr. Fairbanks delivered fact-based evidence derived from his extensive experience with Jordanian IPP transactions, including technical and commercial insights into the 458 MW combined cycle electric facility. He performed a detailed review of the relevant Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and other supporting documents to provide accurate, professional, and fact-driven statements as a witness. To further support the arbitration, Mr. Golbin assisted with information gathering and research tasks, including the review and analysis of documents related to various PPAs that K&M had previously drafted and negotiated for Jordan’s IPP projects. This included in-depth research into project documentation, legal agreements, and technical reports to ensure comprehensive and factual support for NEPCO’s position. Additionally, K&M provided strategic advisory inputs during the preparation and review of witness statements, ensuring that NEPCO’s submissions were robust, technically sound, and aligned with the arbitration’s procedural requirements. Through its combined expertise in energy project structuring, PPA negotiations, and IPP advisory, K&M delivered targeted services to address the challenges NEPCO faced in the arbitration. This work underscored K&M’s deep understanding of complex infrastructure projects, dispute resolution, and the critical elements of energy agreements."

An electric utility was interested in developing a couple of pilot mini-grid projects to demonstrate the viability of this solution and to provide valuable lessons for replicating this model throughout the island. One pilot project was at Playa Santa Cruz, a beach in northwestern Curaçao south of the Lagun village. The beach had cabins, restrooms, a bar, and a restaurant. Onsite diesel generators were used for power generation. The beach could have attracted more visitors and locators with a more affordable and reliable source of electricity. It also could have attracted more visitors if the beach and road leading up to it were illuminated by streetlights powered by the mini-grid. The proposed Playa Santa Cruz mini-grid system included a fully off-grid hybrid solar PV and BESS system, an underground low voltage grid through the beach area, approximately 20 LED streetlight poles (which lit up from about 18",

Technical aspects Detailed analysis regarding the basic technical aspects of the implementation, pipeline and related infrastructure to connect to potential off-takers, etc. This component is expected to include a mapping of the proposed aqueduct and potential off-taker locations. Financial and contractual aspects Based on the analysis above estimate the expected seasonal volume demand per potential off taker and estimate the capital and operational costs required to deliver the water to each offtaker. Regulatory Impacts Detailed analysis of proposed regulatory changes in the Water Code including regulation related to desalination, and groundwater and surface water abstraction. Analysis of the impact of these proposed regulations as well as the upcoming constitutional reforms on the sale of desalinated water."

LUCELEC understands that the St. Lucian grid is not currently built to resist the strongest of storms (Category 5 and above) and intends to update its grid construction standards and take actions to incrementally improve system resilience so that it is capable of withstanding Atlantic storms, which are expected t increase in severity and frequency due to climate change. In preparation for these actions, LUCELEC engaged K&M Team to prepare a study that would address the following two major topics: Providing a means of measuring current grid resilience and setting annual resilience targets and Analyzing the electrical network infrastructure in St. Lucia using inspections, models, and other tools to identify a pipeline of projects to increase the resiliency of the transmission and distribution networks, generation assets, and LUCELEC's solar farm. During the course of the study, K&M will develop a reliability metric that would allow LUCELEC to major their progress in improving system resilience, review and analyze the system data, conduct interviews with LUCELEC’s senior staff, perform a site visit, identify the pipeline of the climate resilience projects, and prioritize the projects to allow LUCELEL to develop a specific grid resilience improvement plan."

OLTP engaged POWER Engineers for support in ensuring a total load of 8 MW can be provided to industrial clients at Oserian via a high-voltage interconnection to Kenya Power and Light Company’s (KPLC) 33 kV distribution grid located nearby to avoid short-term use of diesel generation while OLTP further develops its geothermal resources. K&M was engaged by POWER Engineers on a project to support the development of a geothermal/solar hybrid industrial park in Naivasha, Kenya by providing an analysis of the requirements for interconnection of the industrial park to the national grid of Kenya to supply backup power. This project provided technical assistance for the specification and design of a synchronized interconnection between the nearby 33kV KPLC line to the OTLP 11kV mini grid. K&M’s scope of work included: Assessing the commercial and economic viability of the KPLC interconnection and its impact on the cost of power to OTLP’s industrial clients Identifying the factors that influence the economics of the project and of combined power provision by both geothermal resources and the KPLC distribution grid Recommending an operating procedure for decision makers to choose between OTLP geothermal/solar and KPLC grid-provided power As part of its scope of work, K&M considered a range of technical options coupled with capital and operating expenditures (CAPEX, OPEX) to assess the economics of grid-supplied vs. geothermal-supplied electrical energy. K&M incorporated factors such as KPLC time-of-use and bulk rate electricity tariffs, expected utilization characteristics of OTLP electrical load (timing, intensity, duration), and estimate investment and operational requirements to model and evaluate the project economics. K&M identified factors that influence the economics of the project and evaluated their sensitivity and impact during fluctuations. Lastly, K&M provided clear recommendations and operating procedures that identify when to use OTLP-provided geothermal power and when to use KPLC grid-provided power. K&M compared the two (2) options (OTLP or KPLC supplied energy) on the basis of the lowest cost per unit of electricity under standard assumptions and produced a Cost-Benefit Analysis for the project."

          "description": "The energy systems of Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Dominica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis are highly dependent on fossil fuels. Estimates and drilling results show these countries have 160 MW of geothermal energy production capacity. However, this capacity is significantly greater than the local demand. This situation provides opportunities to use the excess geothermal energy in creative ways that can promote the energy transformation in the Caribbean. Two examples are exporting the excess geothermal power to nearby islands or using it for electrolysis to create green hydrogen—a clean and versatile energy carrier. The objective of this assignment is to assess the potential synergies between excess geothermal energy production capacity not needed for local use in the Eastern Caribbean and the creation of a Caribbean-based green hydrogen market. K&M carried out a pre-feasibility assessment for green hydrogen production from geothermal power and commercialization in the Eastern Caribbean (EC) with a focus on Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Dominica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. This includes an electricity sector analysis, estimating the geothermal energy potential, and conducting a geothermal energy cost analysis. K&M will also estimate demand for green hydrogen for energy, industrial use, heavy transporting and petrochemical production in the EC and Trinidad and Tobago. Our team will then identify the likely export opportunities for green hydrogen produced in the EC, required technologies and options for production and export of green hydrogen, and an inter-island hub for green hydrogen logistics and international export. Our team will also estimate the volume of green hydrogen produced from excess geothermal power in the EC, determine the investment needs to produce green hydrogen from geothermal sources, and estimate the levelized cost of green hydrogen. Further, we conducted a cost benefit analysis of green hydrogen vs. subsea transmission and battery storage. These activities will feed into the development of a preliminary business model for a green hydrogen network in the EC. As part of this work, we will identify the technical, commercial and regulatory barriers for a regional green hydrogen market, analyze the potential business models to support the development of that market, identify contractual schemes to deliver green hydrogen to T&T, and determine the range of pricing for green hydrogen offered to key regional and international markets from T&T."

          "description": "(CONFIDENTIAL: do not mention client’s name and country) K&M was hired by Golden Oil to assess the feasibility of a Small-Scale LNG Receiving Terminal at Ras Issa, Yemen. Golden Oil is a subsidiary of the HSA Group—a multinational corporation with ownership of 41 industrial, service and commercial companies in Yemen. Most of HSA’s subsidiaries use diesel, LPG or coal for their power generation, transport fleet, furnace or chilled water requirements. The high of these fuels limit HSA’s competitiveness and Yemen’s economic growth. HSA is interested in exploring if LNG could be used to replace these fuels, and to lower HSA’s electricity cost. HSA also has ambitious plans to develop an industrial zone, including a seaport, at the Ras Issa area. HSA retained K&M to assess if HSA’s power generation units, transport fleet, and furnaces could be converted to LNG; where could LNG be sourced from and what types of ships could bring LNG to Ras Issa; what type of import terminal could be viable at Ras Issa; what type of logistic solution could be used to transport LNG from Ras Issa to each factory in Yemen; and if the cost of LNG delivered at each company’s site could be lower than the cost of the fuel currently used. K&M’s scope of work included: Performing a gas demand estimate that will focus on assessing if HSA’s power generation units, transport fleet and furnaces could be converted to LNG; estimating their efficiency and LNG consumption after conversion; and estimating the cost of conversion. As part of this work, K&M will also identify chilled water requirements that could be satisfied with the cold released when LNG is regasified Identifying potential sources of LNG supply and practical options for small-scale shipping LNG from a selection of potential regional terminals to the Ras Issa LNG import terminal. Estimating the FOB LNG price from potential regional terminals. Estimating the freight costs (USD/MMbtu) for shipping LNG from selected potential regional terminals to the Ras Issa LNG import terminal, and calculating LNG prices (US$/MMbtu) delivered ex-ship at the Ras Issa LNG import terminal Conducting LNG terminal options analysis, which will include: preliminary metocean analysis, site characterization/basis of design, description or conceptual illustration of LNG terminal solutions identified including the conclusions from the initial feasibility assessment, and cost estimates (CAPEX and OPEX) for each of the LNG terminal options Conducting LNG logistics options analysis, which will include: description conceptual illustration of logistic solution for each end-user or receiving station, description and analysis of LNG cold recovery technology options, and levelized cost estimate (US$/MMbtu) for each end-user or receiving station Options comparison, which will include: an all-in cost for each terminal and logistics solution for each end-user, and an explanation of the main assumptions used to derive these costs, comparison of LCOG or LCOE with current fuel or electricity costs (similar comparison for chilled water costs), the estimate of the viable LNG demand, and sensitivity analysis of this demand to changes in key variable, and the matrix comparing all terminal and logistics solutions against each other and using the criteria agreed during Task 1, and recommendation on a preferred solution Conducting new power plant analysis, which will include: electricity demand estimate, Preliminary site, and technology and configuration analysis, Power plant and interconnection cost estimates, as well as LCOE, and LCOE comparison and recommendation on whether a new power plant is a better choice than LNG delivered by truck Analyzing the business model, which includes: Identifying risks related to the construction, financing, and operation of the preferred LNG import and logistics solution; developing contracting and procurement options for the development and operation of the preferred LNG import and logistics solution; and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each option, and recommend a preferred option Drafting a preliminary implementation plan and Terms of Reference Developing a financing plan, which includes: developing a financial model of the project; develop the project’s preliminary financing plan; Identifying significant project risks and viable mitigation measures; preparing an Information Memorandum (IM) describing the Project; Identifying investors who could be interested in funding the Project’s development and implementation costs; holding consultation meetings with prospective investors; and assisting and negotiating a joint development agreement."

The objectives of the project included: (i) conducting a targeted global mapping to identify and shortlist key markets (8-10 countries primarily in Africa and Asia ) for FPV investments, both as an add-on to existing HPP assets and as stand-alone systems on existing reservoirs, lakes and other water bodies, that will lead to private sector investments in 2-5 years; (ii) identifying and assess the different private sector business models and their pros and cons including identifying potential private sector sponsors with whom IFC could potentially engage to pursue FPV activities; (iii) carrying out cost benchmarking (balance of system and O&M costs) and technical standards setting; and (iv) providing support for small-scale pilot projects, where appropriate, as proof of concepts to catalyze future scaled-up investment. The scope of work included: (i) Task A: Conducting a targeted global mapping to identify 8-10 countries across regions: 4-5 countries in Africa and 4-5 countries in Asia for FPV investments in the next 2-5 years. In addition, include any high potential countries in Latin America and/or Europe and Central Asia that will be useful for the study. (ii) Task B: Identifying suitable business models for the target markets and their pros and cons. This will explore: i) different ownership structures of the solar assets, especially when combining with HPP assets where the existing ownership can both be public and private; and ii) different types of contracts including solar PPA with utilities, PPA amendment to that of an existing HPP, merchant power, or captive generation for commercial and industrial users. (iii) Task C: Providing a guidance document comprising technical standards and cost information to facilitate future project identification and development including: i) Estimates for balance of system and O&M costs as well as technical standards for other components in the system; ii) Safety standards and best practices for electrical equipment and cables; and iii) Recommendation for mitigation measures against risks of corrosion, flooding, loss of buoyancy, wind uplift, performance ratio, etc. and their subsequent impacts on LCOE. (iv) Task D: Identification of up to two pilot installations as proof of concept to develop the technical capacity, help in commercialization and standardization, secure political agreement from regulators, and attract private sector investors in certain markets. K&M’s scope of work is to: Providing a list of Target Countries based on high-level screening criteria, such as regulatory capacity, institutional capacity, transaction viability and high level FPV potential. Conducting a 3-step assessment including a market, regulatory and tariff assessment, evaluation of potential ownership structures, and evaluation of potential contract structures to develop business model recommendations and identify which business models are applicable / viable for each Target Country and for IFC investment. K&M will also consider medium / smaller size business models in addition to HPP and utility-scale IPPs. Developing a business model matrix with an overview of each applicable business model and its opportunities / risks / challenges, provide a decision-making roadmap for FPV deployment in each Target Country, and identify key stakeholders, including broad roles and responsibilities, and define interactions among stakeholders. Defining long-term investment demand for each Target Country, taking into consideration existing legislation, regulations, contractual models and tariff frameworks, institutional frameworks and roadmaps, typical dispatch processes, gaps and shortcomings in contracting models and tariff structures; typical and required interactions & licenses; existing plans and actions needed in terms of country-wide energy planning and infrastructure development, CO2 reduction targets and associated current and planned policies for their implementation. Developing indicative financing plans for FPV business models and prospective co-financing opportunities for each Target Country. Based on estimated capital investment and country-specific electricity pricing, K&M will calculate indicative preliminary estimates (not investment grade) of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for different business models. Producing a sponsor mapping and engagement strategy based on precedent activity in particular country or region, current interest in country, proven, relevant FPV or solar developer experience, financial capacity to be a co-sponsor, previous experience working with institutions such as IFC or WB, including E&S standards, and eligibility to be an IFC partner"

          "description": "The IDB Group and CDB, with the assistance of K&M, completed the initial development of a proposed insurance facility for water utilities (CWUIC SP). CWUIC SP was established as a new segregated portfolio (SP) within CCRIF SPC, formerly the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. K&M advised on CWUIC’s main components, governance framework, budget (including potential sources of funding and uses), and identified target members. A first-of-its-kind in the region, CWUIC SP had three components: Component 1, the CWUIC Response Program, was a mutual aid program between participating water utilities implemented and managed through agreements with CAWASA and CWWA. Component 2 offered parametric insurance to cover water utilities from natural disasters. Component 3 was a lending facility that provided utilities access to financing for investments in loss control measures. K&M led the development of each component, and the scopes of work required to get CWUIC operational in 2022. K&M also engaged closely with governments and water utility managers to learn more about their major assets, vulnerability to natural hazards, and objectives for insurance coverage. The K&M team presented, alongside IDB and CCRIF SPC, on the progress of CWUIC SP at the High-Level Forum for Caribbean Ministers Responsible for Water in October 2021. The team continued advancing the development, implementation, establishment, and operationalization of CWUIC SP to serve water utilities in 2022. Prepared the CWUIC options report detailing the alternatives for establishing CWUIC and the selected option Delivered a PowerPoint presentation on CWUIC alternatives to describe the report’s findings Drafted meeting agendas with CCRIF, CDP, and CDB and recorded agreements reached Developed a work plan as agreed by IDB and CCRIF Produced a report on proposed roles and responsibilities of the CWUIC SP Management Committee Submitted recommendations on the cell rental fee and other charges CWUIC as an SP should pay CCRIF Updated Sections 3 and 4 of the Feasibility Study, agreed upon by IDB and CCRIF Advised IDB in defining final objectives and content for Component 3 Created an Excel file with the proposed annual budget for CWUIC SP for its first three years Updated and presented reports on CWUIC as an SP Compiled an Excel file with stakeholder contacts and provided summary briefings of related workshops or events Supported presentation delivery at the HLF at the CWWA Congress Prepared documentation detailing position descriptions and staff profiles contracted for CWUIC SP Developed scopes of work for studies to be funded by PPCR Drafted MOUs with CAWASA and CWWA Submitted a report detailing regulatory approvals or exemptions for CWUIC SP to issue insurance policies in member jurisdictions Drafted boilerplate ownership and membership agreements Produced a report explaining the rationale for the proposed terms and conditions of the insurance policies Drafted a Business Plan Developed a standardized dataset in Excel for each selected utility"

CUC is considering LNG as a new fuel for power generation. There are several LNG import solutions that Cayman could consider, and the majority of them are likely to result in a cost of fuel that is lower than diesel. However, before proceeding with the development of a specific solution, CUC wants to develop an LNG-to-Power strategy that considers all the technically viable LNG-to-Power options, and narrows the options to two or three that have the lowest costs, a manageable level of risk, and could be implemented in a reasonable timeframe. *** K&M was hired by the Caribbean Utilities Company (CUC) to review and finalize a work-in-progress version of the LNG-to-Power strategy for the Cayman Islands. K&M is identifying viable sites and commercial structures for small-scale LNG import terminals that include combinations of floating vs. onshore storage and floating vs. onshore regasification systems, different storage tank sizes, as well as ISO containers. K&M will also analyze CUC’s LNG-to-Power procurement options and work with CUC to identify the most effective procurement strategy. Then, K&M expects to be engaged to draft, compile, and prepare all the RFP documentation and assist CUC in managing the RFP process. K&M’s scope of work includes: Request and review information on CUC’s gas requirements, thermal generation units, Cayman Port, and previous studies and proposals (Task 1) Virtual Kickoff Mission and Workshop (Task 2) Identify viable sites and commercial structures for LNG import terminals that include combinations of floating vs. onshore storage and floating vs. onshore regasification systems, different storage tank sizes, as well as ISO containers. Each option should consist of a viable solution for transporting the gas (pipeline) or LNG (LNG truck, ISO containers) to the power plant site. (Tasks 3-4) Analyze CUC’s LNG-to-Power procurement options and work with CUC to identify the most effective procurement strategy. This strategy should seek to maximize competition from qualified bidders and make proposals binding and comparable. (Task 5) Write, compile, and prepare all the RFP documentation including the corresponding annexes, as well as organize and manage a virtual data room that bidders can use to prepare their proposals (Task 6) Assist CUC to manage the RFP process by answering questions from prospective bidders, receiving and compiling bid submissions from all bidders, and preparing a bid evaluation report (Task 7) Finalize the LNG-to-Power business case for CUC (Task 8)"

This report will include benchmarking the key operational and financial indicators for water utilities in the Caribbean, exploring the scope of benefits from implementing Non-Revenue Water (NRW) reduction projects, assessing the impact on COVID-19, and identifying levels of resilience to natural disasters. This report will also provide recommendation to governments and water utilities on actions they can take to improve performance and resiliency of water utilities. K&M will: Benchmark the operational and financial performance of water utilities in the Caribbean. This will also include benchmarking access to water and sanitation, quality of service, operating efficiency, and affordability of tariffs. Complementing the work IDB has recently been doing to assist water utilities in the Caribbean with reducing NRW, we will highlight utilities that have had success in reducing NRW (for example, NWC in Jamaica, BWS in Belize, and WSC in The Bahamas) and show how that success has contributed to improved operational and financial performance. Describe the impact of COVID-19 has had on water utilities in the Caribbean, including an assessment of the impact on demand, revenues, collections, operating expenses, and liquidity. Detail the physical and monetary damages that water utilities in the Caribbean have incurred from natural disasters in recent years. Provide recommendation to governments and water utilities on actions they can take to improve performance and resiliency of water utilities."

          "description": "K&M was contracted to assist WEB to perform a background check of five companies (“Tenderers”) that will be invited to submit proposals for a turnkey contract for the construction of the 18,000 m3/day seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) 3 plant in Aruba. The background check covered the Tenderer’s activities in their country of origin (location of their headquarters) and their subsidiaries in countries where they are active. The background check aimed to identify red flags that WEB could consider when deciding if any of the five Tenderers should not be invited to submit a proposal. To this end, the background check included a review of the legal, reputational, and financial background of each Tenderer. K&M first determined the country where the Tenderer had its headquarters. K&M then reviewed FATF publications, including the latest Consolidated Assessment Ratings and High-Risk Jurisdictions-Subject to a Call for Action to determine if the Tenderer country of origin has any strategic ANL-CFT deficiencies. K&M identified the Tenderers, if any, whose country of origin was listed as a High-Risk Jurisdiction or rated as “Low Level of Effectiveness”, and/or has strategic technical areas rated as “Non-compliant”. K&M assessed if any of the five Tenderers is included in the list of ineligible firms published by the World Bank, EBRD, IDB, and other multilateral financial institutions. Ineligibility was determined when a firm had used corrupt, fraudulent, coercive, or other undesirable practices. K&M also searched online for the name of the firm in combination with words such a “corruption”, “corrupt, “fraud”, “fraudulent” and “coercive” to find any news articles, publications, reports, etc., that mention the firm as an entity engaged in undesirable practices. K&M reviewed the Dun & Bradstreet Comprehensive Credit Reports to determine if any of the five Tenders or their subsidiaries and branches located in the countries listed in the project description had ongoing legal disputes. If any of the Tenderers had ongoing legal disputes, K&M searched online for information available about the dispute, the risk that this dispute could present to the Tenderer, and the Tenderer’s ability to implement the SWRO project. K&M performed the track record assessment by searching online for the Tenderer’s name along with words such as “project failed”, “project terminated”, “project delayed”, “project over budget”, “did not meet performance guarantees”, etc. K&M also searched the DesalData database for information on projects implemented by any of the Tenderers, and that failed to meet design specifications or failed for any other reasons. K&M calculated financial ratios that provided an indication of the Tenderers’ financial strength relative to the size of the SRWO 3 turnkey contract and performance guarantee. These ratios included net worth / SWRO 3 capex; average 3-year gross revenue / SWRO 3 capex; net worth / value of performance guarantee; etc. K&M obtained the information to calculate these ratios from the financial statements included in the Tenderer’s latest annual reports. K&M also used Dun & Bradstreet credit reports obtained to perform the check of legal disputes to obtain additional information on the financial strength of the Tenderers and their subsidiaries. Finally, K&M prepared a PowerPoint presentation with the findings of the background check for each company and with any recommendations that resulted from the analysis."

          "description": "IFC is developing an LNG terminal situated in the harbor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, based around a floating storage unit (FSU). The envisioned facility would be comprised of an FSU, a mooring system, two small LNG carriers, and a small onshore facility with regasification, truck and ISO container filling capabilities. With this combination of assets, the LNG terminal company would be able to provide LNG and natural gas in Freetown and deliver small parcels of LNG to ports in Guinea (Kamsar, Conakry) and Liberia (Buchanan, Monrovia). K&M was hired to perform the demand analysis for potential LNG / gas offtakers in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. K&M’s scope of work included: Sierra Leone Performing an Industrial and Mining Demand Analysis: The project will include the means to put LNG onshore, where there will be the capability to load LNG trucks and ISO containers and to provide a regas service. Within the Sierra Leone market, there is potential for broad uptake of LNG by industrial users in the food & beverage, agribusiness, cement, hospitality, and other segments, most of which would be served via LNG trucking. In addition, the LNG terminal expects to provide a regas service for the Western Area Power Generation Project that is under development with a target COD of 2022. Establishing a Sierra Leone LNG Users Forum: K&M will design an users forum that is proto-LNG consumer organization designed to provide information about LNG to potential users, help them understand competitive fuel economics, and map LNG demand in Sierra Leone by location, size, sector, and other relevant aspects. The forum will be a vehicle for raising the profile of the LNG terminal project within Sierra Leone. Guinea Conducting the Guinea Demand Assessment: Detailed work is required to understand the depth and breadth of demand from the Kamsar-Boke bauxite corridor in Guinea as well as potential thermal power and industrial demand in and around Conakry. In the mining sector, K&M will assess both short-term demand for LNG-to-power and medium-term demand related to mining equipment (diesel to LNG conversion) and alumina refining. As there may be some level of industrial and commercial demand for LNG in the Conakry area, K&M’s demand assessment will cover this area as well. Establishing a Virtual Guinea Miners LNG Users Forum: K&M, working with the Guinean mining and industry associations, will create a virtual Guinea LNG users forum, with an objective of convening potential users and facilitating the exchange of information. The key mines are bauxite operations in the Kamsar-Boke corridor; currently there is a market for LNG in power and ore drying operations, and this may grow significantly as operators invest in alumina refining. Liberia Undertaking a Thermal Power Generation Demand Assessment for Liberia Electricity Corporation: Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is an immediate need for up to 50 MW of LNG-fired power in Monrovia that would be used to complement hydropower and serve as a load-area reserve for LEC. K&M will explore this possibility in its demand assessment. Carrying out a Liberia Mining Demand Assessment: K&M will carry out a high-level assessment of LNG demand in the Liberian mining sector, extending beyond demand coming from the significant Arcelor-Mittal operations in the country."

K&M reviewed the financial model (including assumptions around financing arrangements and tariff mechanisms), and the economic and commercial aspects of the project (including relevant risks and rewards of the business case). The economic analysis included an understanding of market demand, as well as an analysis of the utility’s revenue streams, operating costs, and financing arrangements, to determine its ability to meet the obligations under the PPA so that an economic rate of return could be calculated. The two activities carried out as part of this consultancy were: Activity 1: Support for the Nevis Island GE Project Activity 2: General Support to the CDB on GE Projects As part of Activity 1, an Inception Report was submitted to describe the work completed to date on the Nevis Island GE Project, identify the next steps, and provide preliminary conclusions regarding the key challenges for the project and the consistency of the financial model the developer had prepared. The subsequent steps for the assessment of the Nevis Island GE Project included: Reviewing the financial and technical capacity of the developer Conducting reviews of the relevant contracts Developing a thorough understanding of the business case and financial model Preparing an economic analysis to assess the utility’s ability to meet its PPA obligations Developing a risk matrix for the project Making recommendations for reallocating risks where necessary Carrying out a comprehensive review of the financial model and business case Ensuring the project met the SEF requirements for funding of sub-projects"

K&M reviewed relevant project documents and contracts; conducted a site visit to interview the construction management staff and to verify the progress of the works; and finally prepared a report with a summary of findings and conclusions. In the second phase, K&M was required to review and validate a Valuation Report submitted to the Lenders by the owner and developer of the CHP plant. K&M reviewed the Valuation Report; reviewed the CHP project financial models submitted by the project company; reviewed relevant sections of the project agreements and financial agreements; and finally prepared a report with the main findings, conclusions, and K&M’s independent opinion on the reasonableness of the CHP plant Valuation Report, the financial model assumptions, and compliance with the requirements of Tranche 1B Bond Issuance Condition."

The Client also plans to develop a built-for-purpose chip mill at Puerto Carreño. The ideal location for the power plant is either Puerto Lopez or Puerto Gaitan. These locations are ideal as they have: i) power evacuation through the regional transmission system via 115 kV transmission lines and substations, and ii) accessibility to the Client’s plantation in Vichada through Meta river. The Client expects that the power plant will be commissioned in 2021/2. The client engaged K&M to perform a pre-feasibility study that identifies revenue sources for the project and the rules and regulations that govern how the project could access those sources.

The steam & turbo generators are being replaced with dual fuel 6 x 17MW 50DF Wartsila reciprocating engines. WEB wants to switch this generation from HFO to natural gas using imported LNG. LNG will be received, stored and regasified at an LNG import terminal. WEB perform a pre-FEED to analyze 15 terminal location and configuration options and selected a selected a land-based storage and regasification facility at the Barcadera port. the LNG storage and regasification facility will be located on a new reclaimed area; LNG will be stored in a full containment tank with a net storage capacity of ~19,000 m3. Maximum cargo lot size for LNG deliveries will be 9,000 m3. LNG will be regasified utilizing in-tank booster pumps and ambient air vaporizers. Boil-off gas will be managed using send-out gas compressors. Natural gas will be delivered to the WEB power plant via a 2 km 6” gas pipeline. Dredging to ~8.5 m will be undertaken to provide a new berth and turning basin such that the Terminal can safely receive LNG carriers of up to 7.5 m draft, 145 m LOA and 17,000 gross tonnage. LNG carriers will berth on newly built quay the south side of the newly reclaimed area located to the east of the existing port quay. This quay and mooring dolphins will be constructed, and mooring systems will be installed, including Quick Release Hooks (“QRHs”). LNG transfer system (and vapor return system) from LNG carriers to/from shore will utilize industry standard aerial cryogenic hoses, Emergency Release Couplings (“ERCs”) and hose support saddles (all within the scope of the Terminal). LNG will be unloaded to the storage tank via cryogenic pipeline. The main objective of this FEED study is to perform Front End Engineering Design for the selected LNG terminal location and configuration. K&M is overseeing site studies required to obtain the data and information needed to perform FEED which includes FEED on marine infrastructure; LNG storage, regasification and topside facilities; gas pipeline and receiving facilities; and other infrastructure / facilities required for the LNG terminal. K&M is developing Class 3 cost estimates for all the works and equipment required by the LNG terminal. K&M is also conducting an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and assist WEB to request and obtain permits for construction, dredging and operation of the LNG terminal. K&M will develop technical specifications for the EPC contract(s) Request for Proposal (RFP) package."

K&M assessed the past two extreme weather events on the power systems of the Caribbean islands listed above, identifying risks and vulnerabilities, recommending energy resilience measures for generation assets and T&D systems, and developing an investment plan to undertake the measures. K&M first collected data on the islands’ power systems, and then analyzed extreme weather events’ impacts. The assessments involved interviewing the islands’ utilities (undertaken by POWER) and evaluating prior power system vulnerability studies. Under the direction of K&M, POWER conducted physical and engineering inspections of the most vulnerable power system assets identified by the utility personnel, and a reliability and criticality assessment. The reliability and criticality assessment involved the following tasks: analyzing system reliability, identifying elements that could cause power service interruption, identifying substation and T&D locations subject to flooding, and understanding system performance under contingencies by reviewing T&D system studies."

K&M’s work included estimating demand for LNG, identifying 15 options for importing LNG (including FSRU, FSRBs, FSUs, onshore regasification and storage, two sites, gas pipelines, LNG trucking, and ISO containers) and performing conceptual design for each option. K&M developed class 4 cost estimates and a model for estimating LNG ex-ship price for each option (based on the optimal LNG supply route and optimal size LNGC), and performed preliminary environmental and social impact analyses of each option. K&M developed a financial model to estimate the levelized cost of gas at the power plant battery limit for each option and identified and analyzed several options for developing the terminal, including EPC and Build Operate Transfer (BOT) contracts. Based on this analysis, K&M recommended an onshore storage and regasification option with a terminal that can receive LNG carriers of up to 8,000m3 and a 2 kilometer pipeline to deliver gas to the power plant. Based on K&M’s results, WEB decided to proceed to performing FEED on the LNG terminal and competitively procuring the LNG supply."

WEB Aruba N.V. is planning on developing an LNG-to-Power project to help reduce the cost of electricity from HFO-fueled power plants. As part of its work during Phase 1, K&M performed an independent review of the business case to ensure consistency and coherency throughout the document, as well as a review and audit of the economic and financial models. During Phase 2, K&M performed technical due diligence on the existing generation system, identified eight technology and configuration options (including reciprocating engines, gas turbines in simple and combined cycle) for improving the efficiency of the existing system, calculated the levelized cost of each option (with HFO and natural gas), and recommended the optimal option. After confirming that there is a business case and selecting the optimal generation technology and configuration, K&M commenced work on Phase 3, which consists of assisting WEB manage a process for competitively selecting an LNG supplier. The process includes three steps: discovery (prospective suppliers are identified and consulted on their interest on the project), prequalification, and a request for proposals. K&M is performing, under a separate contract, a pre-FEED study of the terminal for receiving, storing and regasifying LNG."

The Olkaria VI power plant is being developed through a PPP arrangement governed by the PPP Act, 2013. The PPP Unit is embedded within the Kenyan National Treasury. KenGen will supply steam to the power plant. The power plant will be developed by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which will be majority owned by a private sector partner. K&M’s scope of work included preparing a feasibility study to establish the optimal project commercial model, contract structure, and technical configuration, and confirm the bankability of the Olkaria VI project. K&M’s staff recommended the best Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, advised KenGen on risk allocation, and prepared all necessary project agreements. K&M has also prepared the request for qualifications and request for proposals and will advise KenGen through the procurement process and proposal evaluation, as well as provide transaction advisory support through to financial close. Given that this project is being developed under Kenya’s Public Private Partnerships Act, K&M is responsible for ensuring that all documents and processes are compliant with said Act and for supporting KenGen and a special Governmental PPP Unit in obtaining required approvals. During all stages of the assignment, K&M has been responsible for managing a team of advisors which includes AECOM as geothermal technical advisor, international and local counsel, and environmental specialists."

K&M was engaged after successfully assisting the World Bank with the conceptual design of the fund in an earlier stage of the fund’s development. The purpose of the pre-feasibility study was to assess the market demand for the fund’s services and to develop a more detailed proposal for the fund’s organization, management, capitalization needs, and product offerings. K&M performed a market sounding for the fund’s services with renewable energy project developers who had been shortlisted under Egypt’s Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) program. K&M conducted an online survey, hosted a workshop in Cairo, and held follow-up interviews with project developers to identify the most serious market barriers for raising project financing and which of the fund’s potential services would be most helpful in addressing these barriers. From the market sounding, K&M determined that the fund would be most effective by creating a foreign exchange liquidity facility to address issues with limited currency convertibility between Egyptian pounds and U.S. dollars, and by offering technical assistance to the Government’s implementing agencies for fulfilling their responsibilities in the project development process. K&M developed detailed options for how the proposed liquidity facility would operate and how its services would be priced. K&M prepared a financial model of the facility and performed sensitivity analysis of the facility’s major risks. The results of the market sounding and financial analysis were incorporated into a pre-feasibility study report. The report was submitted to key decision-makers for approval of the fund’s continued development."

The project converted the existing 3x66 MW oil-fired facility into a 485 MW combined-cycle using natural gas and distillate fuel. The Central Electricity Generating Company of Jordan (CEGCO) was sponsoring the project, and the revitalized power plant will operate as an IPP under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with NEPCO. K&M performed a technical evaluation of CEGCO’s proposal and an extensive review of all project agreements, including the PPA, Implementation Agreement, and Lender Direct Agreements. Following K&M’s review, K&M supported NEPCO in negotiating the PPA for the project, which was signed in January 2016. The project will cost US$460 million and provide electricity at one of the lowest tariffs in Jordan’s conventional power sector. The project reached financial closing on February 2017."

The fund would support the Government’s clean energy targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, including helping the Government to develop as much as 4,300 MW of privately-financed greenfield solar PV and wind capacity by 2020. The fund would support these efforts by providing technical assistance for project development and by offering various financial instruments to help projects achieve financial closure. K&M was tasked with developing the concept for the fund and supporting the World Bank’s presentation to stakeholders and decision-makers in Egypt. K&M developed the fund’s objectives and designed a range of options for the fund’s structure, management, governance, and operations. Within this scope, K&M evaluated a number of market barriers for renewable energy projects in Egypt. Based on this evaluation, K&M designed and analyzed a number of potential financial instruments which the fund could offer to address these market barriers and help project developers to raise commercial financing. K&M also estimated the fund’s capitalization requirements and the size of its potential operations. K&M produced a concept note and supporting materials to market the concept to government and multilateral stakeholders and potential investors. Following the successful presentation of the concept and its acceptance by key decision-makers, the World Bank proceeded with the fund’s development by conducting a pre-feasibility study and market sounding exercises."

The Ambatovy mine is designed to produce 60,000 tonnes of refined nickel, 5,600 tonnes of refined cobalt, and 210,000 tonnes of fertilizer grade ammonium sulfate per year. The operations audit had two objectives. The first objective was to verify the capital expenditure estimates and operating projections from the mine operator to determine the accuracy of the mine operator’s calculation of payments owed to the Government of Madagascar. The second objective was to assess the quality of the mine operator’s environmental compliance program and to determine whether the program met the operator’s contractual obligations for environmental management and community development. K&M analyzed possible drivers for the mine’s increase in capital expenditure requirements from US$2.5 billion to US$5.5 billion and evaluated the mine’s operating costs and ability to service its financial obligations to the government. K&M also performed the environmental assessment of the mining operations and recommended actions that the government could take to improve its oversight of the operation."

It was structured on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis under a 20-year Energy Conversion Agreement (ECA). The project reached financial close on July 2003. The transaction is the first Saudi independent power project (IPP) to reach financial close and consequently the first Saudi IPP to be financed in the international markets on a limited recourse basis. K&M’s transaction preparation work attracted four bidders: Enelpower, CMS Energy and National Power Company (NPC), Enron and Xenel Industries, and Mitsubishi Corporation.

This effort was directed at reducing the significant financial burden that PLN faced in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, whilst trying to maintain investor confidence in the sector. The renegotiations also had to assure investors that they would not lose their investment, but would receive lower returns. After a detailed analysis of the terms and costs of project agreements for 28 IPPs with a total capacity of more than 11,091 MW (coal, geothermal, gas, diesel and hydro), K&M developed a renegotiation strategy and plan, and then supported PLN through the negotiation of project agreements with each developer. The renegotiations were successfully completed and PLN saved millions of dollars."

K&M organized an international competitive selection process for the EPC contractor, and evaluated/selected the turnkey contractor according to World Bank standards. K&M brought the project to completion, from initial feasibility study to operation, in under 1-1/2 years on time and on budget. The plant, commissioned in 1994 in Kingston, Jamaica, serves as a peaking plant providing support to steam and diesel generators already in service in the area. The new Hunt’s Bay facility consists of a gas turbine (GT 10) engine running on distillate/fuel oil. Phase I technical services included: project feasibility study, conceptual design, bid package documents preparation, proposals evaluation, developer recommendation, and final EPC contract preparation. Phase II technical services included: design review, construction services oversight, and overall quality control for plant construction and start-up. The EPC contractor was the firm of Wallace O’Connor from Texas using local Sub-contractors."

As such, K&M’s involvement in Latin America’s first-ever privately financed non-recourse Independent Power Project (IPP) encompassed a broad range of advisory services. K&M developed this pioneering project on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis and structured the transaction to achieve financial close within a period of only 7 months. K&M worked with the government to develop and reorganize the commercial, regulatory, legal and securities framework to allow for private investment. The Mamonal plant sells electricity to both private industries and the national grid, thus the project structure required negotiation of a full range of issues related to market-oriented operation in the energy sector, including wholesale and retail tariff models and methodologies, fuel supply transportation and pricing, and spot market system. K&M developed risk mitigation arrangements, which included the implementation agreements, long-term lease agreement, and the sales agreements to private and public clients. K&M worked with the various government entities and local partners involved to negotiate the complete terms of the transaction including: fair tariff wheeling arrangements (the first in Colombia); EPC construction contract which included procurement procedures; Power Purchase Agreement (PPA); Security Package agreements; and non-recourse financial agreements. Mamonal’s success was covered extensively in the trade media. It was recognized as “Deal of the Year” in 1994 by Project Finance International Yearbook and “One of the Ten Most Creative Deals” of 1993 by Infrastructure Finance. The contractual guarantees, risk allocation concepts and the incentive structure of the Mamonal transaction, as conceived and negotiated by K&M, are now being used as a model worldwide. The $100 million facility consists of a 100 MW (ISO) natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant in a steam-augmented mode. The power island includes two General Electric LM 5000 steam injected gas turbines (STIG) and two heat recovery boilers (HRSG). It connects to the grid through a 69 kV switchyard and 1 km 69 kV transmission line. Status: Commercial operation 1994."

The project is located in an industrial area at Kingston Harbor, and consists of 3x20 MW low speed MHI diesel units and all associated support facilities. The generators are of a two stroke valveless design and use heavy fuel oil. K&M’s work was organized in two phases. During Phase I K&M reviewed the existing legal, regulatory and institutional framework and identified specific constraints to be addressed before private power projects could be realized. During Phase II K&M analyzed the project’s feasibility; drafted and issued prequalification documents; identified, analyzed and allocated risks; developed the contractual structure; draft tender documents and project agreements; supervised the tendering process; and participated in the bid evaluation, developer selection and contract negotiations. This was the first IPP in the Caribbean and in Jamaica to reach financial close. A principle feature of the financing package was a credit enhancement to facilitate use of Caribbean Basin Projects Financing Authority (CARIFA) 936 bond financing. Additionally, the project secured the first financing offered by Jamaica’s newly established Private Sector Energy Fund, which was developed by the World Bank to promote and facilitate private sector participation in energy development. The US$114 million project reached financial close in 1994 and commercial operation in 1996."

Structured on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis, the transaction secured, for the first time ever, World Bank financing of a private infrastructure project. K&M served in a variety of roles as the project progressed from inception to commercial operation. The project consortium consisted of Xenel Industries of Saudi Arabia, National Power of the United Kingdom, Mitsui & Co. of Japan, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries of Japan, and K&M Engineering and Consulting Corporation of the United States. Phase I: As Privatization and Institutional Reform advisors, K&M played a critical role assisting the Government of Pakistan to address the legal, regulatory and financial reforms that established the institutional framework required for project implementation. Phase II: As Project Structuring and Development advisors, K&M’s was one of the initial architects of the transaction. K&M’s project structuring strategies and risk mitigation techniques were instrumental in attracting private investment and achieving financial close. K&M led the negotiations between the Government of Pakistan, World Bank and consortium of bilateral lenders and commercial banks that resulted in $1.6 billion in funding. K&M managed each aspect of project development which included structuring the Security Package, preparing the International Competitive Bid documents for securing the EPC construction consortium as well as tendering and evaluating bids. K&M developed a highly sophisticated financial model used to determine the tariff structure, internal rate of return and loan drawdown schedule. Significantly, the Hub transaction broke new ground for World Bank participation in private sector infrastructure projects by providing a unique co-financing instrument that would further stabilize the government guarantees. Implemented for the Hub Project transaction, the Enhanced Co-Financing Operation (ECO) Program of the World Bank, in conjunction with the Japan Export-Import Bank (JEXIM), provided over $360 million dollars in guarantees to ease the political, convertibility, and balance of payment risks. Additionally, over 25% of the project financing was arranged through another World Bank loan for $390 million under the Private Sector Energy Development Fund. Phase III: As the overall Project Manager and Owner’s Engineer, K&M provided technical supervision, construction management, commodity procurement support, cost validation, quality assurance, and O&M contractor oversight. K&M supervised the turnkey EPC consortium including over 4,000 personnel that completed the power island, civil works, switchyard, transmission system, substations and associated support facilities. Technical Scope: The Hub Power Project consists of 4x323 high-sulfur, residual fuel oil-fired, steam generating units, a 500 kV switchyard, double circuit transmission line, water and wastewater treatment systems.

        "description": "Sustainable and Inclusive Value Chains in Infrastructure Projects –1 Ports K&M was hired by the IDB to conduct a comprehensive study on enhancing inclusive and sustainable value chains in ports infrastructure projects across the LAC region. As part of this study, K&M analyzed existing operational ports across LAC’s sub-regions to assess the involvement and impact of MSMEs and sustainability practices within their value chains. This evaluation considered the percentage of MSMEs engaged, their contributions, and their demographic characteristics. K&M further identified new commercial opportunities for MSMEs within the ports’ value chains and pinpointed sustainability practices that could be replicated. Lessons from this analysis were applied to four port projects, assessing their suitability for IDB Invest financing, and outlining challenges and recommendations for implementing more inclusive and sustainable value chains. K&M then recommended a suite of solutions for IDB and IDB Invest to foster sustainable practices and MSME synergies. Lastly, K&M suggested other infrastructure sub-sectors where these best practices could be applied, identifying challenges and providing a matrix for potential implementations. As part of this work, K&M reviewed and selected a minimum of four operational ports across LAC’s distinct sub-regions, examining them for meaningful commercial relationships with MSMEs and the promotion of sustainable strategies. Through in-depth analysis, K&M assessed the involvement, sustainable practices, and challenges of MSMEs within these ports’ value chains, focusing on their percentage involvement, sustainability initiatives, and the benefits and challenges arising from their engagement. Drawing from earlier findings, K&M identified and evaluated new commercial opportunities for MSMEs across various segments of the ports’ value chains. This involved determining criteria based on market conditions and specific characteristics of both the MSMEs and the ports. K&M conducted interviews with target MSMEs to understand their potential roles in the value chains and as port service users. Four port projects were then scrutinized to determine the applicability of lessons from prior analyses. The objective was to understand the challenges and advantages of evolving toward a more inclusive and sustainable value chain within the port context. K&M developed an action plan with detailed recommendations and strategies for effectively integrating sustainable practices throughout the value chain. To identify opportunities for leveraging sustainable practices and enhancing MSME engagement, K&M familiarized themselves with the financial and non-financial services offered by IDB and IDB Invest. A solutions portfolio was recommended to clients, highlighting the challenges faced in providing IDB Invest solutions. Projects were prioritized based on their potential for efficient implementation of these services. K&M extrapolated from the analysis to suggest other infrastructure sub-sectors where best practices could be implemented. This involved identifying challenges within those sub-sectors and providing guidelines to overcome them. The culmination of this activity was a matrix illustrating sectors where the lessons learned could be effectively deployed. IDB Invest also engaged K&M to conduct a study on best practices and opportunities in inclusive and sustainable value chains for port infrastructure projects in the LAC region. The primary focus was to identify components within the value chains during the construction and operation phases of ports, particularly those involving MSMEs, and to assess current sustainability trends. K&M’s approach began with a deep analysis of ports’ value chains, covering both construction and operational stages. The study identified all products and services within the value chain, analyzed their sequence, and evaluated criteria such as technical requirements and certifications needed from suppliers. The research also explored procurement processes to determine the roles of various stakeholders like project sponsors, operators, or third parties. A key aspect of the study was to recognize areas of the value chain with significant MSME participation, ranking them based on factors such as MSME involvement, product complexity, and supplier capability. Furthermore, K&M explored prevailing sustainability practices in ports, covering topics such as decarbonization, climate change adaptation, and biodiversity conservation. This involved comparing current practices across existing LAC ports and considering MSMEs as integral users of the port. K&M’s research methodology encompassed both primary and secondary data sources, including statistical data, academic literature, and industry studies. They also utilized recent value chain analyses from the IDB Group and gathered insights from interviews with industry experts, businesses, and port operators. The findings were documented in detailed reports and visual presentations, with regular feedback sessions held with the IDB Invest team to ensure alignment."
